  "OperationActor — one list/confirm/disclosure/dispute operation = one
  supervised actor run, expressed as a langgraph-clj StateGraph. The
  advisor (VehicleSale-LLM) is sealed into a single node (:advise); its
  proposal is ALWAYS routed through the VehicleSaleGovernor (:govern) and
  the rollout phase gate (:decide) before anything commits to the SSoT or
  is disclosed.

  One graph run = one operation (intake → advise → govern → decide →
  commit | hold | approval). No unbounded inner loop.

  Human-in-the-loop = real approval / dispute-review workflow:
  `interrupt-before #{:request-approval}` pauses the actor and hands the
  decision to a human reviewer (title officer). The reviewer resumes with
  `{:approval {:status :approved}}` (or `:rejected`)."
